A single-cell spatial-temporal transcriptomic atlas of liver regeneration under normal and fibrotic condition, including a total of 30 mouse liver samples obtained from 15 normal and 15 fibrotic mice at timepoints Day 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7 after a partial hepatectomy (PHx) procedure with three replicates for each time point, followed by the scRNA-seq and SRT sequencing for each sample using the Stereo-seq platform.
